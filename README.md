Tutorial on how to use GitHub

I've programmed in Python 2.7 and C++, as well as HTML and CSS. I plan on using GitHub to learn more coding and putting any 
projects I do so that others may see them if they wish, give me advice/help, and hopefully make something useful someone else
can enjoy. Thanks for browsing!
